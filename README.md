# Code Quiz Challenge
_When the start button is clicked, the quiz container is displayed, and the quiz begins. The displayQuestion function displays the questions and answer options, and the click event listener for the option buttons checks if the answer is correct and moves to the next question. The timer starts when the quiz begins, and when the time runs out, or all questions have been answered, the gameOver function is called to display the final score. Overall, this code implements the basic requirements of a code quiz game._
